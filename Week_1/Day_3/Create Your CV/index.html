                    <p>A personal profile, also known as a CV summary, is the opening statement of your CV. It is a short introduction which outlines your personal characteristics, telling the prospective employer what kind of a person you are, the attributes and qualities that you possess and the work experience that you have.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>If you have incomplete education, you can list any completed coursework in your education section. You can take steps to boost the section with certifications or other professional development achievements. You can even consider having a separate professional development section, showcasing how you’ve continued education relevant to the job. This is often just as valuable to employers if directly related to experiences you’ll have on the job. Here are a few examples:</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Here are three effective ways to structure the job experience section of your resume:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        <b>Chronological format</b>
                        In a chronological resume, you will list your work history with your most recent job at the top. This is the most widely used format because it shows clearly how you progressed through your career. This method works best if you have at least a few years of consistent employment experience.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                        <b>Functional format</b>
                        With the functional resume format, you’ll categorize your achievements and skills according to the requirements of your desired job. You’ll only need to mention the names of your previous employers and durations of employment under your work history. Since this format focuses on your achievements and skills instead of the job positions you held, it is a suitable option if you are a recent graduate or have significant gaps in your employment history.</p>
