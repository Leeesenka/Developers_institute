Congratulations on your "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" game code! I have reviewed it and wanted to provide some feedback:

1. Code Structure:
   - Well-organized with classes for questions and game logic.
   - Clear separation of concerns for maintainability.
   - Code is DRY.

2. Database Integration:
   - Good use of `psycopg2` library for PostgreSQL database integration.
   - Fetching questions dynamically allows for easy content management.

3. Game Logic:
   - Solid implementation of game flow and question presentation.
   - Randomized answer shuffling adds to the user experience.

4. User Interaction:
   - Clear instructions and prompts make the game engaging.
   - Options to quit and milestones enhance gameplay.

One suggestion to enhance the game further would be to add wildcard options, similar to the ones available in the real program.
Wildcards could provide assistance to the player, such as eliminating two incorrect answers, asking the audience for their opinion, or seeking help from an expert.
By incorporating wildcards, you can increase the suspense and strategic element of the game, making it even more exciting for the players.

Keep up the excellent work!
